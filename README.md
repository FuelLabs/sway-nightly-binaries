# Fuel Nightly Binaries

Every day at **00:00 UTC**, the workflows in this repository checks out
the [sway] and [fuel-core] repositories, builds `forc` and `fuel-core`
and creates nightly binary releases for both.

These binaries are made available through [fuelup] (WIP).

[sway]: https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway
[fuel-core]: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core
[fuelup]: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup
